# Raycasting
Raycasting is a rendering technique used in 2D and 3D computer graphics. It involves shooting a "ray" from a given position in a specific direction and determining what it hits. Used extensively in 3D game engines and simulations, raycasting calculates the angle, distance, and resulting pixel height of a given object from the viewpoint of a player or camera. It's a computationally efficient way of creating perspective in games, allowing for the creation of pseudo-3D environments using 2D maps.<b>

And because I am not smart at all. The angle calculations will be done by somebody else that is smarter than me.
